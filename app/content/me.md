Hi, I'm Philip a Webbprogrammer and a student at Blekinge Institute of Technology in Sweden.

I originate from the capital city of Stockholm, Sweden, where I lived and grew up for most part of my life. At the moment I live in Ronneby, Sweden, a small town close to nature.

In my spare time I enjoy playing MMORPGs (Massively Multiplayer Online RolePlaying Game), watching anime and reading mangas. I also enjoy working on tabletop RPGs, which is close to a storytelling session with other people acting out what their characters say and do. Music and art is central in my life and I enjoy playing the guitar and bass as well as drawing using my IPad and Photoshop.

My programming knowledge started out very limited, only having a solid grasp in HTML and CSS from my experience in Webbdesign . Now I have completed a beginnerscourse in C++, C and Java as well as getting a solid grip of PHP (both Object Oriented and not) and MySQL.
